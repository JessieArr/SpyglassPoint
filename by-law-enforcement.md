# Spyglass Point Condominium Association of Pensacola, Inc.
I. ENFORCEMENT OF DECLARATION, BY-LAWS, CONVENANTS AND RULES
The Board of Directors (“the Board”) of the Spyglass Point Homeowners Association (“the
Association”) is granted the authority to enforce the rules and covenants under the Declaration
of Condominium (“the Declaration”) and by Florida Statute.
The Board solicits three volunteer Owners from the community to serve on a committee of other
unit owners who are neither Board members nor persons residing in a board member’s
household, to serve as the Spyglass Point Homeowners Association Fines Committee (“the
Fines Committee”) for the purposes of impartially enforcing the Declaration, By-Laws,
Covenants, and Rules and Regulations, or Florida Statutes (together the “Covenants”).
The Association’s rules regarding the enforcement of the Covenants are as follows:
1. If an Owner violates or is otherwise liable for a violation of the provisions of the Covenants,
the following shall occur:
a. 1ST Notice of Violation:
Upon the first offense of any provision to the Covenants, the Owner(s) shall be issued a
Notice of Violation and shall have 14 calendar days from the date of the Notice to correct
the violation.
b. 2ND Second Notice of Violation and Notice of Hearing; fees begin accruing:
Upon a second offense of a reoccurring violation, the Owner(s) shall be issued a Second
Notice of Violation and Notice of a Hearing. The Owner will be requested to attend a
hearing to discuss the matter with the Spyglass Point Homeowners Association Fines
Committee (the “Fines Committee”). The Fines Committee reserves the right to proceed
with the hearing should the owner not attend. Failure of any owner to attend the
hearing will be considered an admission by the owner of the validity of the violation of
the Covenants specified in the Notice of Violation, and the Owner will be subject to the
assessment of fines (see Article II – Schedule of Fines below).
Following the hearing, the Fines Committee will issue a “Notice of Determination” to
the Board and Owner(s). The notice shall communicate the decision/conclusions
reached by the Fines Committee regarding the alleged violations.
c. 3RD Notice of Violation (and Notice of Hearing, if applicable):
Upon further or continuing violations of the Covenants by any Owner, the Fines
Committee may, but is not required to, request the Owner to attend additional hearings.
The matter may be forwarded to the Association’s attorney for appropriate legal action.
All attorney fees and costs incurred will be the responsibility of the Owner.
d. FINAL Notice of Violation and Attorney Referral
The Fines Committee will remit the violation case to the Board for further consideration.
2. Any Owner assessed a fine(s) must pay such charges within fourteen (14) days of the date of
the notice. Failure to make the payment in the specified time frame may subject the Owner to
legal or equitable remedies necessary for the collection thereof.
3. The Board may suspend, for a reasonable period of time, the right of Owner(s), or an Owner’s
tenant(s), guest(s), or invitee(s), to use the common elements, common facilities, or any other
Association property for failure to comply with any provision of the Covenants.
a. If an Owner is more than 90 days delinquent in paying a monetary obligation due to
the Association, the Association may suspend the right of the Owner(s) or the unit’s
occupant(s), licensee(s), or invitee(s) to use common elements, common facilities, or any
other association property until the monetary obligation is paid in full. This does not
apply to limited common elements intended to be used only by that unit, common
elements needed to access the unit, utility services provided to the unit, or parking
spaces.
b. The Board may suspend the voting rights of a unit or member due to nonpayment of
any monetary obligation due to the Association which is more than 90 days delinquent.
A voting interest or consent right allocated to a unit or member which has been
suspended by the association may not be counted towards the total number of voting
interests necessary to constitute a quorum, the number of voting interests required to
conduct an election, or the number of voting interests required to approve an action
under the Covenants. The suspension ends upon full payment of all obligations
currently due or overdue to the Association.
c. The suspensions specified above must be approved at a properly noticed board
meeting. Upon approval, the association will notify the Owner(s) and, if applicable, the
unit’s occupant(s), licensee(s), or invitee(s) by the United States Postal Service or hand
delivery.
4. The remedies hereunder are not exclusive, and the Board of Directors and/or Fines
Committee may, in addition to notice or action already taken, take further action as provided
for in the Covenants. Notices of Violation may also contain such demands as are necessary to
protect the interests of the Association in accordance with the provisions of the Covenants,
especially those which may represent a hazard or risk to the safety and security of the
Condominium and community.
5. If any Owner feels they have been wrongfully or unjustly charged with a violation, the
Owner may proceed as follows:
a. Within fourteen (14) days after the Owner is given Second Notice and hearing notified
pursuant to 1(b) above, the Owner may submit, in writing, a protest to the Fines
Committee stating the reasons why the Owner feels they did not commit a violation.
b. At the hearing, the Fines Committee shall hear and consider the arguments, evidence,
and/or or statements by the Owner regarding the alleged violation. After the hearing,
the Fines Committee shall notify the Board of Directors and the Owner of its
determination regarding the alleged violation(s) via the United States Postal Service or
hand delivery.
d. Fines shall become due and payable as specified in the Notices of Violation, unless the
Fines Committee determines that the violation was made in error, in which case the
Board of Directors and the Owner shall be notified of the determination as described
above. However, if the violation is determined to be valid and is not corrected and/or
the assessed fines remain unpaid, the Board of Directors retains the right to exercise
other legal or equitable remedies if the Owner has not made a good faith effort to
address and/or correct the violation.
II. SCHEDULE OF FINES
1ST Notice of Violation - No fine assessed as long as the violation has been addressed and/or
corrected before the 14-day (calendar days) warning period has elapsed.

specified due date listed in the Notice of Determination.

potential referral to the Association’s attorney for review.
