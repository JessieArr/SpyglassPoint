h. Next Report on Food Truck event
Daniel Dorman provided an update on events; tried to get 3D Eats and Tea out in March, gave them some
time to provide documentation which was not provided, followed up and provided some, two days prior
to the event. Not enough time to invite our neighbors in Sugartree and Windchase to bolster turnout and
make the events worthwhile for the food trucks. Suggested a new date, did not respond. Who Cuts the
Cheese has been contacted, response pending and will follow up on Monday.
Will again follow up with Lonestar, were pleased with initial turnout. Will talk with Mike about what
other food trucks we can have come out. Mike suggested we have a food truck and a desert truck come
out at the same time. Apologized for the cancelation of the March food truck, but liability was a concern
for all parties involved without proper documentation.
Jason Robbins asked Kevin Etheridge about contacting Windchase and Scenic Trace about inviting them.
Patty had contacted Windchase and Sugartree asking if there was an interest in the collaboration. Kevin
would reach out. Only restriction would be that they would have to walk as parking is limited at Spyglass.
i. FPL trimmed tree limbs off of power lines
Patty Martinez mentioned the completion of FPL trimming trees off of power lines. Visibility has
improved safety. FPL attempted to place us on the backburner, Board thanked Patty for being assertive in
getting FPL to come out and addressing the tree issue.
Ad-Hoc Pest Control Update: Second notice coming up in May, email for Management company has
been provided to Florida Pest Control to ensure no lapse in inspection/coverage.
5. SERVPRO — Emergency Ready Profile for storm/hurricane mitigation and permanent repairs
Patty Martinez dialed in Joe Lovell and put him on speaker phone. Spyglass was looking for oversight
over the process, ensuring control and communication with the company which SERVPRO provides well
along with enhanced technology solutions. Daniel Dorman asked Joe about mitigation options, not so
much remediation. Joe discussed SERVPRO’s Emergency Ready Profile (ERP) process — which is a
walkthrough with Spyglass to assess needs. Partnership with SERVPRO is a free service, gentlemen’s
agreement, in turn hoping we would choose to use SERVPRO’s services.
e Jason Robbins motioned to move forward with SERVPRO as Spyglass service provider; Daniel
Dorman seconded; passed unanimously.
o 5 Yes Votes: Patty Martinez, Daniel Dorman, Jason Robbins, Barry Boyd, Natalia
Chapman

b. Insurance wind mitigation/Renewal Insurance deductible
Insurance is due May 24, 2022 — obtained quotes on discount for insurance if Spyglass obtains new wind
mitigation — Insurance Co. was indeterminate on whether or not Spyglass would get a discount, answer
was “already have one, so maybe.” Discussed with Kevin Ethridge; should start getting quotes as little as
14 days out from the renewal date, happy to jump in and assist.
Kevin volunteered additional companies (BlueTeam and NCRI) that Ethridge has worked with to great
success, makes things a lot easier and used them on a number of projects; could work in concert with
SERVPRO following any major storms/hurricanes to restore Spyglass. Would not have to sign over an
Assignment of Benefits, however agreement could provide priority following a storm; which would be
good as much as SERVPRO will be able to do for Spyglass, they could not guarantee priority as they
have other contracts, such as with DOD. Kevin and Patty to meet, Patty to reach out to the companies; put
on May agenda.
