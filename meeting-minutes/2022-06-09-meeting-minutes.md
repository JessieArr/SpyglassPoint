3. Financial review ending 4/30/2022 & 5/31/2022
- Review Aged Receivables — status
Patty Martinez forwarded the updated, but unreconciled financials from the management company. Some items need to be corrected. The reserve funding and insurance reserve values had been updated: $10,200 in Reserve Funding, $33,164 in Insurance Reserve Funding. Jason Robbins, Treasurer did not have anything additional to add regarding the financials. 17 unit owners are late on their monthly dues/assessments, board is requesting management company send a letter and an email to the owners who are behind on dues payments. Clif Cirk requested information regarding bundling of checks and a late fee was assessed, later the late fee was corrected.
Financials need to be reconciled as the transfer of information from Liberty Community Management and Etheridge was incomplete and pending bank statements. Board will send the information to the CPA as they conduct the Financial Audit to assist the board in correcting and updating the financials so they are accurate. Daniel Dorman motioned that the review of the financials beginning 4/30 and ending 5/31 be tabled until review with CPA is completed; Jason Robbins seconded. Motion passed unanimously.

4. Old Business
Update status on repairs to common elements — 1) Pool grand opening ceremony, 2) repair and coat sealing street and paint lines & letter & number to curbs
Pool has been completed, now open. Repair/coat sealing, paint lines has been completed. Unit letter painting on curbs have not yet been completed as some of the curbs are smaller and Bryon will need to obtain a different stencil that will fit so he can complete the work.
Status on Structural Engineer with Joe DeRuil Assoc.,
Received and update from them, were supposed to be out on May 26, scheduling conflict on the next available date, May 27; will come out the following week to resume their work. Exact date has not been specified. Engineer is hoping to have Engineering Assessment completed at the end of June or first of July.
Status on financial audit/review & Reserve Study
CPA has had some additional questions for the board.
Reserve Study has been completed, Patty has requested a meeting with the Reserve Company and the Board to review the reserve study. However, the Board is going to wait until the completion of the Engineering Assessment to release the results of both at the same time.
Status on M & H Insurance Claim Status/Repairs — Hurricane Sally
Board has met with the attorneys, they are conducting additional research into the insurance company closing our open claim. We received an email that the Insurance company had closed the investigation without HOA signing off. M&H missed deadline to provide the insurance company with requested information. Attorneys completed some research and is of the opinion that the Insurance company cannot close an open case and will be sending a letter to the insurance company. Some items on M&H discussion are attorney-client privileged information and will not be discussed in an open and public meeting. Meeting with M&H pending, looking to get the WindMit inspections completed, and have the electrical and fans installed and completed sometime in July. Understanding was that there is no dividing wall between units in attic space which would make installation easier, but will need to be confirmed. According to Clif Cirk, cannot cross the breezeway between units.
Status on Fines Committee and amendments
Daniel Dorman updated the fines committee policy and associated HOA fines policy consistent with the feedback from the Attorney. Completed policy has been sent to Ethridge and will be sent out to owners via mail and email and put on the management company's website. Have three community volunteers who are already on the Fines Committee, will be meeting on their own via teleconference and Board will make available the Zoom account information to the Fines Committee members. As far as what the Board is responsible for, Board is still working with the attorney to clarify this. However, in consultation with the attorneys, so far it is appearing as though the HOA is responsible for the vast majority of items covered under the bylaws as written.
Next Report on Food Truck event
Daniel Dorman has followed up with Lonestar — no response has been received. In conversation with Patty Martinez, we believe the food truck community Facebook may have indicated to the Food truck vendors in the area that Spyglass was a low-turnout venue. Board wanted to invite our neighboring communities to increase turnout, but in order to demonstrate that we need an event, however requests for Food trucks have gone unanswered.
Status on repair of easement to the drainage pond & pool gutter. Completed. Concrete and rain gutter have been completed.

Status on Vending machine in the pool
Daniel Dorman sent the board the vending machine options. Board needs to decide if we want a vending machine. If we decide we do, a dedicated outlet and breaker will need to be installed. Company tried to deliver a vending machine prior to a final decision.
Jason Robbins reiterated that the board can set the prices on the machines and the additional funds could be used towards the pool/pool area needs. $2.00 for 20oz drinks, $2.25 for Gatorade, $3.25 for BANG energy drinks. Machines hold 680 cans/300 bottles, 12 beverage options. Total for initial investment would be $1,360.00. If we increased prices by .50c, that would only be a $340-dollar profit.
Would the machine be used enough to have a return on our investment? Investment includes the 20AMP circuit breaker and outlet installation and initial purchase of product. Angela Henrichs was of the opinion that the board would be better served investing those funds on something else. Taylor Loftin stated he would get a quote on electrical items needed for installation. Company provides the machine, but possible we may need to pay for insurance on the machine.
Tabled until Taylor Loftin obtains quote on electrical updates to pool house.
Status on Sunbiz.net — renewal with current board members & EPM Management company has updated Sunbiz account.
Status on setting up Zoom annual membership Management company is working with their IT people to set up.

Daniel Dorman motioned to accept quote for $5,400 to repair the beams on B6, H7,18, K8, L8, and P7; Taylor Loftin seconded. Discussion: Patty Martinez stated the HOA would be responsible for the paint and cost as such, board will provide color chart and authorizes additional costs of the paint.

Poly pipes were ALL evaluated by the general contractor and will provide an updated quote to have the outside faucets brought up to code/repaired.
I. Status on signing contract with Blue Team- Hurricane/storm recovery
In consultation with the attorneys, Board was informed that the contract with M&H is a "firm and fixed" contract.

5. Status 2022 Spyglass Renewal of insurance and insurance wind mitigation/Renewal Insurance deductible
Buy down deductible on Wind
Insurance Deductible - Special Assessment for 2022 in an event of casualty based on property values Insurance renewal went up to $104,550.69; increase of $12,269.69 over last year. Deductible was 5% on the values of the buildings, approximately $584,000; unit owners would have been responsible for paying $4,733.00 per unit within 30 days of a named storm/casualty loss assessment.
The board determined that this was unacceptable for the community writ large and made the decision to buy down the insurance deductible for $36,161.00, to be paid from the reserves. The deducible buydown brings the deductible down to 2% of the values of the buildings, approximately $233,000; unit owners are now only responsible for paying $1,941.00 per unit within 30 days of a named storm/casualty loss assessment. (A savings of $2,792.00 per unit).
On the recommendation of the Management Company, and due to the limited timing of the insurance renewal date, the board conducted a poll via email. The board reconfirmed it's votes for the deductible buydown. Passed unanimously:
o 6 YES votes: Patty Martinez, Daniel Dorman, Jason Robbins, Taylor Loftin, Clif Cirk, Angela Henrichs

Working groups tabled.
New Business
a) According to Florida Statues, a unit owner may, at their expense, install an Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging station with a 220V outlet for the purposes of charging their electric vehicles; must be metered appropriately. Association cannot prevent an owner from installing the station, but it will be at the owner's expense. A known unit is charging their EV using an extension cord which is not appropriate and also represents a safety hazard to the community. A violation letter will be sent out to owner's charging an EV. Board will ensure that any EV charging stations are uniform; if during installation the asphalt must be cut, the owners would also need to pay for this aspect of the installation as well. It is only proper

that they charge their vehicle in a designated parking spot which has a properly installed, up-to-code EV charging station. if installed, the EV charging station would be considered an "improvement" on the common elements and is subject to the board's review to ensure uniformity and consistency with safety standards. Owners will need to submit documentation and quotes prior to work being commenced. There are locations in Pensacola where owners can charge their EV's without running an extension cord.
Daniel Dorman will research the requirements for an EV charging station to assist the board in coming up with a policy ensuring uniform EV charging station standards.
Lewis Pitts may have been creating issues for community residents again in J building, playing loud music. Board has sent notices and at last update there were no issues, sounds as though it's possible the issues were abated because he was not present. Possible that his return may have also coincided with the return of nuisances, such as loud music, as defined under the bylaws.
Jason Robbins brought up the installation of a new pool gate lock with a numerical combination lock, versus the existing method which requires owners to have a key. Jason Robbins to obtain a quote on installation of a combination lock.
