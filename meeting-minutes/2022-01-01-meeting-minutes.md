violations.

b. Financial Audit
The process used during the board meeting in November was done incorrectly. All of the
questions which werâ‚¬ proposed at &e November meeting should only have been directed
at the board, and this is according to Rene Wind from the Management Company. At that
time, the questions were voted olt as owners, and we should not have voted. Should have
only been the board members. AII other questions were fine. Finaucial audit question was
actually a tie. Speaking with Rene that this board has the authority, since it was lt tie, that
we have the ability to yote on a financial audit if we so choose to do so. Emailed Jay
about proxies, there were two proxies, oile from a homeowner who sold their properfy the
day of the board meetingo and the other from a board member. Proxies are not allowed for
board members at a board moeting, so you cannot just turn your proxy over to someone
else. With that being said, there were still 4 members present at the meeting. This board
is faced with voting on whether we want to have a financial audit.
r Daniel Dorman motioned to move forward with a financial audit, motion
seconded by Taylor t oftin. Motion passed unanimously by the board.

c. Proposal for property improvements
Covered in presentation to the board by East Bay.
d. Corner Lights -J.D.Ingram
13 corner lights remain which still need to be replaced, which will cost $4,000.Right
now, they are \ryarm lights, will be replaced with lights of similar brightness with what is
currently up. Bulbs will be changed in the existing lights.
r Taylor Loftin made a motion to have J.D. Ingram continue with the replacements,
motion seconded by Daniel Dorman. Motion passed unanimously by the board.

e. East Bay l"andscaping Service Maintenance
Patty asked if we wanted to vote, or go over the proposal. Barry Boyd said we should
table, regarding security cameras in front. The security cameras issue was tabled as too
cost prohibitive. Board briefly reviewed Patfy Martinez's proposed phased improvement
plants; discussion regarding the total costs io lawn maintenance contracts, current budget
was for $30,000; would increase to $44,500, which would include pest, fertilizer, etc.
Inigation maintenance is to be handled separately by Riker. First year budget for lawn
maintenance would be $44500; second $455m, and third year fi6,0ffi. This is for the
service maintenance contract, not the improvementslbeautification contract.
r Jason Robbias motioned to accept the proposed service maintenance contract
from East Bay Laudscaping for $44500; motion seconded by Daniel Dorman.
Motioned passed with 4 "Yes" votes from Patty Martinez, Daniel Dorman, Jason
Robbins,Taylor Lofton and 1 "No" vste from Barry Boyd stating he would like
to lmk at it more closely.

Improvement Plan (see attachments) of the Spyglass Point property which includes
incremental increases in HOA dues, assessments to ownsrs, and does rol include

1 1. Member Comrnerts/Concerns
Sandy (87) brought up concerns regarding the placement and direction of the security lights.
Photocells may not be working. Taylor Loftin stated that we would tske note to have them
adjusted and cells checked. Patty Martiuez requested that Sandy send an email to patty or Jay,
with the details of her concernlrequest.
Maintenance form on the matragement compaxy's website should be used, that way it is
captured. Single-source input from the owners.
Bob (87) gave his thanks for the activity and dedication of the board, and feels the proposal for
the improvements looked great. Comparing us to Wyndchase isn't a bad thing, as there are
obviously similarities. Stated we've done a good job. Eastbay Landscaping seems to do a good
job, pleased with the selectioq.

Board and members diseussed the lack of action and effect on values of the property.
Improvements are coming with a different plan, things will fall into place. patty Martinez has
talked with owners and they don't mind paying if they're getting something from it.
