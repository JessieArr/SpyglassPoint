# Spyglass Point
Spyglass Point is a condominium complex located in Pensacola, Florida.

The complex is run by its board of directors, and managed by Etheridge Property Management.

This website is a compendium of the documents and records published by and about the management of this condo complex. Its goal is to make these documents available in a searchable and more accessible format for Spyglass Point's residents, owners, and interested parties.

Some documents were only provided to the community as images. Accordingly I have used online OCR software to convert them to text. I have used [PDF24's OCR Tools](https://tools.pdf24.org/en/ocr-pdf) for this purpose.
